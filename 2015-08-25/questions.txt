## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

T_s = Startup time
T_c = Time to count one person
T_g = Time to gather one count and do arithmetic

Now assume uniform size rows and columns.
r = size of a row
c = number of rows
(So r*c = n, where n is the number of persons).

Then total time = T_s + r*T_c + c*T_g

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

n*T_c

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

Solve T_s + r*T_c + c*T_g <= n*T_c for n.

If we assume that T_s is negligible, and that r = c = sqrt(n), this has a nice
closed form solution of 
n >= (T_c + T_g)^2 / T_c^2
